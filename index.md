The philosophy of 'BCH709 Introduction to Bioinformatics' is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that student can get their own bioinformatics work done without pain. This illustrates the concept of bioinformatics analysis and Next Generation Sequencing for genomics including hands-on bioinformatics, understanding genomics through bioinformatics, use of command-line in multiple platforms, use of command-line tools to analyze sequencing data, and connecting to and using cloud computing.

> ## Course description
>As contemporary biologists we have entered an age where the use of computers in our daily work has become all but essential. The manipulation and analysis of DNA, RNA, and protein data by electronic means has become a routine task. Further, the amount of DNA, RNA and protein sequence data we are putting into databases every day is expanding at a geometric rate, and with coming advances in sequencing technology, this rate is only expected to increase. With all this new data, analysis by individual humans is simply not possible. Thus, in the past 15 years, computational biology has emerged as a field concerned with storage, manipulation, and extraction of valuable information from all this new data. However, because computational biology is an emerging field, organized courses are generally saved for higher-level study, and often are not required parts of an undergraduate curriculum. We seek to fill this void in education and create a course that will introduce students to bioinformatics at an earlier point in their education. This knowledge will prove to be not simply useful, but essential, for any student considering a degree in any area of biology and medical science.

## Optional Additional Meeting

### _Research Computing Hackathon_  ([Hosted by HPC team](https://www.unr.edu/research-computing/hpc))  
 [Mathewson-IGT Knowledge Center, MIKC 414 or MIKC 121](https://events.unr.edu/mathewson-igt_knowledge_center_508#.XVyb3OhKiiM)  
Please check the [schedule here](https://events.unr.edu/search/events?event_types%5B%5D=28250&order=date&event_types%5B%5D=44657)
Every Friday at 2:00pm to 4:00pm

[Hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) provide a space for hands-on training and solution development within a Research Computing environment at the University. This is also a place to get clarification on questions/concerns regarding the HPC environment. Please bring problems to challenge the HPC team, the Office of Information Technology, and research colleagues. If you don't need help, we still encourage you to attend and share your time and expertise with those in need of assistance. You don’t need to be an expert to attend a hackathon. Individuals at all computing skill levels are welcome! Won Yim will attend this hackathon.

### _Meeting with Won Yim_  
[Howard Molecular Science 216](https://goo.gl/maps/o41BMmcawsTPoES57)  
After Thursday class, we can have a meeting. We are not providing financial aid, but we can discuss your research bottleneck in terms of bioinformatics perspective. **Please schedule after Tuesday class.**
