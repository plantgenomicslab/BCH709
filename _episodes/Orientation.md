The philosophy of 'BCH709 Introduction to Bioinformatics' is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working with data so that student can get their own bioinformatics work done without pain. This illustrates the concept of bioinformatics analysis and Next Generation Sequencing for genomics including hands-on bioinformatics, understanding genomics through bioinformatics, use of command-line in multiple platforms, use of command-line tools to analyze sequencing data, and connecting to and using cloud computing.

> ## Course description
>As contemporary biologists we have entered an age where the use of computers in our daily work has become all but essential. The manipulation and analysis of DNA, RNA, and protein data by electronic means has become a routine task. Further, the amount of DNA, RNA and protein sequence data we are putting into databases every day is expanding at a geometric rate, and with coming advances in sequencing technology, this rate is only expected to increase. With all this new data, analysis by individual humans is simply not possible. Thus, in the past 15 years, computational biology has emerged as a field concerned with storage, manipulation, and extraction of valuable information from all this new data. However, because computational biology is an emerging field, organized courses are generally saved for higher-level study, and often are not required parts of an undergraduate curriculum. We seek to fill this void in education and create a course that will introduce students to bioinformatics at an earlier point in their education. This knowledge will prove to be not simply useful, but essential, for any student considering a degree in any area of biology and medical science.

## Academic dishonesty policy:
Academic dishonesty is against university as well as the system community standards. Academic dishonesty is defined as: cheating, plagiarism or otherwise obtaining grades under false pretenses. Plagiarism is defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one's own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one's work to be used in this fashion. Cheating is defined as l) copying homework assignments, 2) cheating on quizzes or exams including sharing answers with students in other sections of the course, 3) obtaining or providing unauthorized information during an examination through verbal, visual or unauthorized use of books, notes, text and other materials; 4) obtaining or providing information concerning all or part of an examination prior to that examination; 5) taking an examination for another student, or arranging for another person to take an exam in one's place; 6) altering or changing test answers after submittal for grading, grades after grades have been awarded, or other academic records once these are official, 7) including information in written assignments without proper citations.  
	Disciplinary procedures for incidents of academic dishonesty may involve both academic action and administrative action for behavior against the campus regulations for student conduct. The procedures involve the determination by the faculty member pursuing concerns over alleged cheating or plagiarism as to whether administrative action is warranted, in addition to making a determination as to any academic consequence. 
	Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated and penalties can include: (1) canceling the student's enrollment in the class without a grade; (2) filing a final grade of "F"; (3) awarding a failing mark on the test or paper in question; (4) requiring the student to retake the test or resubmit the paper. See the “Student Conduct Information” section of the UNR General Catalog for specific University policies and procedures regarding academic dishonesty. For more details, see http://www.cis.unr.edu/ecatalog/Default.aspx?article_list_id=11076 UNR General Catalog.

**Note: all assignments need to be independent work. File sharing, command line sharing will be considered as cheating.**


## Attendance Policy:
You are required to attend lecture/oral presentation/discussion sessions. If you cannot attend due to circumstances beyond your control, the instructor kindly requests the professional courtesy of being notified of your absence ahead of time. Class participation points will be deducted for each unexcused absence (5 points per class missed without informing the instructor before the class meets). For a full description of UNR’s class attendance policies, please see: “https://www.unr.edu/administrative-manual/3000-3999-students/3020-class-absence-policy.

## Plagiarism Policy:
Plagiarism (copying all or part of someone else’s work and passing it off as your own) is a serious form of academic misconduct and will not be tolerated in this class. Plagiarism is defined as submitting the language, ideas, thoughts or work of another as one’s own; or assisting in the act of plagiarism by allowing one’s work to be used in this fashion. “The work of another” does not just mean whole papers or articles copied from another source.  It includes any information, ideas, sentences, or phrases that came from somewhere other than your own head (i.e. books, articles, internet sites, videos, documents, lecture notes or handouts from other courses, and any other sources used in your paper). These must be properly acknowledged by providing references either in the text or in a footnote, along with a bibliography giving the complete publication information for all sources used in your paper. Even if you paraphrase someone else’s ideas and do not quote them directly, you still must acknowledge your source. Citations should also be given for little known facts and statistics. Ignorance is not an excuse for plagiarism. If you are not sure whether you need to provide a source for a piece of information or how to cite a source, ask the course instructor.  

## Students with disabilities statement:
“Any student with a disability needing academic adjustments or accommodations is requested to speak with me or the Disability Resource Center (Pennington Achievement Center Suite 230) as soon as possible to arrange for appropriate accommodations.” This course may leverage 3rd party web/multimedia content, if you experience any issues accessing this content, please notify your instructor.
