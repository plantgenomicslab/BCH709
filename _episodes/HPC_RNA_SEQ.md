## Using Pronghorn (High-Performance Computing)

**Pronghorn** is the University of Nevada, Reno's new High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. The GPU-accelerated system is designed, built and maintained by the Office of Information Technology's HPC Team. Pronghorn and the HPC Team supports general research across the Nevada System of Higher Education (NSHE).

Pronghorn is composed of CPU, GPU, and Storage subsystems interconnected by a 100Gb/s non-blocking Intel Omni-Path fabric. The CPU partition features 93 nodes, 2,976 CPU cores, and 21TiB of memory. The GPU partition features 44 NVIDIA Tesla P100 GPUs, 352 CPU cores, and 2.75TiB of memory. The storage system uses the IBM SpectrumScale file system to provide 1PB of high-performance storage. The computational and storage capabilities of Pronghorn will regularly expand to meet NSHE computing demands.

Pronghorn is collocated at the Switch Citadel Campus located 25 miles East of the University of Nevada, Reno. Switch is the definitive leader of sustainable data center design and operation. The Switch Citadel is rated Tier 5 Platinum, and will be the largest, most advanced data center campus on the planet.

Pronghorn is available to all University of Nevada, Reno faculty, staff, students, and sponsored affiliates. Priority access to the system is available for purchase.

## Slurm Start Tutorial
Resource sharing on a supercomputer dedicated to technical and/or scientific computing is often organized by a piece of software called a resource manager or job scheduler. Users submit jobs, which are scheduled and allocated resources (CPU time, memory, etc.) by the resource manager.

Slurm is a resource manager and job scheduler designed to do just that, and much more. It was originally created by people at the Livermore Computing Center, and has grown into a full-fledge open-source software backed up by a large community, commercially supported by the original developers, and installed in many of the Top500 supercomputers.

Gathering information
Slurm offers many commands you can use to interact with the system. For instance, the sinfo command gives an overview of the resources offered by the cluster, while the squeue command shows to which jobs those resources are currently allocated.

By default, sinfo lists the partitions that are available. A partition is a set of compute nodes (computers dedicated to... computing) grouped logically. Typical examples include partitions dedicated to batch processing, debugging, post processing, or visualization.

### sinfo
```bash
sinfo
```

```
PARTITION      AVAIL  TIMELIMIT  NODES  STATE NODELIST
cpu-s2-core-0     up 14-00:00:0      2    mix cpu-[8-9]
cpu-s2-core-0     up 14-00:00:0      7  alloc cpu-[1-2,4-6,78-79]
cpu-s2-core-0     up 14-00:00:0     44   idle cpu-[0,3,7,10-47,64,76-77]
cpu-s3-core-0*    up    2:00:00      2    mix cpu-[8-9]
cpu-s3-core-0*    up    2:00:00      7  alloc cpu-[1-2,4-6,78-79]
cpu-s3-core-0*    up    2:00:00     44   idle cpu-[0,3,7,10-47,64,76-77]
gpu-s2-core-0     up 14-00:00:0     11   idle gpu-[0-10]
cpu-s6-core-0     up      15:00      2   idle cpu-[65-66]
cpu-s1-pgl-0      up 14-00:00:0      1    mix cpu-49
cpu-s1-pgl-0      up 14-00:00:0      1  alloc cpu-48
cpu-s1-pgl-0      up 14-00:00:0      2   idle cpu-[50-51]

```
In the above example, we see two partitions, named batch and debug. The latter is the default partition as it is marked with an asterisk. All nodes of the debug partition are idle, while two of the batch partition are being used.

The sinfo command also lists the time limit (column TIMELIMIT) to which jobs are subject. On every cluster, jobs are limited to a maximum run time, to allow job rotation and let every user a chance to see their job being started. Generally, the larger the cluster, the smaller the maximum allowed time. You can find the details on the cluster page.

You can actually specify precisely what information you would like sinfo to output by using its --format argument. For more details, have a look at the command manpage with man sinfo.

## squeue
The squeue command shows the list of jobs which are currently running (they are in the RUNNING state, noted as ‘R’) or waiting for resources (noted as ‘PD’, short for PENDING).
```bash
squeue
```
```

## SBATCH
Now the question is: How do you create a job?

A job consists in two parts: resource requests and job steps. Resource requests consist in a number of CPUs, computing expected duration, amounts of RAM or disk space, etc. Job steps describe tasks that must be done, software which must be run.

The typical way of creating a job is to write a submission script. A submission script is a shell script, e.g. a Bash script, whose comments, if they are prefixed with SBATCH, are understood by Slurm as parameters describing resource requests and other submissions options. You can get the complete list of parameters from the sbatch manpage man sbatch.

>## Important
>
>The SBATCH directives must appear at the top of the submission file, before any other line except for the very first line which should be the shebang (e.g. #!/bin/bash).
>The script itself is a job step. Other job steps are created with the srun command.
>For instance, the following script, hypothetically named submit.sh,
{: checklist}

```bash
nano submit.sh
```

```
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=test
#SBATCH --mail-type=all
#SBATCH --mail-user=wyim@unr.edu
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=1g
#SBATCH --time=8:10:00
#SBATCH --account=cpu-s5-bch709-2
#SBATCH --partition=cpu-core-0

for i in {1..1000}; 
do 
    echo $i;
    sleep 1; 
done

```
would request one CPU for 10 minutes, along with 1g of RAM, in the default queue. When started, the job would run a first job step srun hostname, which will launch the UNIX command hostname on the node on which the requested CPU was allocated. Then, a second job step will start the sleep command. Note that the --job-name parameter allows giving a meaningful name to the job and the --output parameter defines the file to which the output of the job must be sent.

Once the submission script is written properly, you need to submit it to slurm through the sbatch command, which, upon success, responds with the jobid attributed to the job. (The dollar sign below is the shell prompt)
```bash
chmod 775 submit.sh
sbatch submit.sh
sbatch: Submitted batch job 99999999
```



## How to cancel the job?

```bash
scancel <JOB ID>
```

> ## SRA
> Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data, available through multiple cloud providers and NCBI servers, is the largest publicly available repository of high throughput sequencing data. The archive accepts data from all branches of life as well as metagenomic and environmental surveys.
> 
> Searching the SRA: Searching the SRA can be complicated. Often a paper or reference will specify the accession number(s) connected to a dataset. You can search flexibly using a number of terms (such as the organism name) or the filters (e.g. DNA vs. RNA). The SRA Help Manual provides several useful explanations. It is important to know is that projects are organized and related at several levels, and some important terms include:
> 
> Bioproject: A BioProject is a collection of biological data related to a single initiative, originating from a single organization or from a consortium of coordinating organizations; see for example Bio Project 272719
> Bio Sample: A description of the source materials for a project
> Run: These are the actual sequencing runs (usually starting with SRR); see for example SRR1761506
