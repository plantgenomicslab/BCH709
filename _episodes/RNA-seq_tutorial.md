## RNA Sequencing
![RNA Sequencing]({{{site.baseurl}}/fig/rnaseq.png)

1. The transcriptome is spatially and temporally dynamic
2. Data comes from functional units (coding regions)
3. Only a tiny fraction of the genome

>## Introduction
>Sequence based assays of transcriptomes (RNA-seq) are in wide use because of their favorable properties for quantification, transcript discovery and splice isoform identification, as well as adaptability for numerous more specialized measurements. RNA-Seq studies present some challenges that are shared with prior methods such as microarrays and SAGE tagging, and they also present new ones that are specific to high-throughput sequencing platforms and the data they produce. This document is part of an ongoing effort to provide the community with standards and guidelines that will be updated as RNASeq matures and to highlight unmet challenges. The intent is to revise this document periodically to capture new advances and increasingly consolidate standards and best practices.
>
>RNA-Seq experiments are diverse in their aims and design goals, currently including multiple types of RNA isolated from whole cells or from specific sub-cellular compartments or biochemical classes, such as total polyA+ RNA, polysomal RNA, nuclear ribosome-depleted RNA, various size fractions of RNA and a host of others. The goals of individual experiments range from major transcriptome “discovery” that seeks to define and quantify all RNA species in a starting RNA sample to experiments that simply need to detect significant changes in the more abundant RNA classes across many samples.

![RNA Sequencing workflow]({{{site.baseurl}}/fig/rnaseq_workflow.png)

### Seven stages to data science
1. Define the question of interest
2. Get the data
3. Clean the data
4. Explore the data
5. Fit statistical models
6. Communicate the results
7. Make your analysis reproducible

### What do we need to prepare ?
### Sample Information
a. What kind of material it is should be noted: Tissue, cell line, primary cell type, etc…
b. It’s ontology term (a DCC wrangler will work with you to obtain this)
c. If any treatments or genetic modifications (TALENs, CRISPR, etc…) were done to the sample
prior to RNA isolation.
d. If it’s a subcellular fraction or derived from another sample. If derived from another sample,
that relationship should be noted.
e. Some sense of sample abundance: RNA-Seq data from “bulk” vs. 10,000 cell equivalents can
give very different results, with lower input samples typically being less reproducible. Having
a sense of the amount of starting material here is useful.
f. If you received a batch of primary or immortalized cells, the lot #, cat # and supplier should be
noted.
g. If cells were cultured out, the protocol and methods used to propagate the cells should be
noted.
h. If any cell phenotyping or other characterizations were done to confirm it’s identify, purity,
etc.. those methods should be noted.





### RNA Information: 
RNAs come in all shapes and sizes. Some of the key properties to report are:
a. Total RNA, Poly-A(+) RNA, Poly-A(-) RNA
b. Size of the RNA fraction: we typically have a + 200 and – 200 cutoff, but there is a wide
range, i.e. microRNA-sized, etc…
c. If the RNA was treated with Ribosomal RNA depletion kits (RiboMinus, RiboZero): please
note the kit used.

### Protocols: 
There are several methods used to isolate RNAs with that work fine for the purposes of RNA-Seq. For all the ENCODE libraries that we make, we provide a document that lists in detail:
a. The RNA isolation methods,
b. Methods of size selections
c. Methods of rRNA removal
d. Methods of oligo-dT selections
e. Methods of DNAse I treatments

### Experimental Design
- Balanced design
- Technical replicates not necessary (Marioni et al., 2008)
- Biological replicates: 6 - 12 (Schurch et al., 2016)
- Power analysis

{: .prereq}

### Replicate number
In all cases, experiments should be performed with two or more biological replicates, unless there is a
compelling reason why this is impractical or wasteful (e.g. overlapping time points with high temporal
resolution). A biological replicate is defined as an independent growth of cells/tissue and subsequent
analysis. Technical replicates from the same RNA library are not required, except to evaluate cases
where biological variability is abnormally high. In such instances, separating technical and biological
variation is critical. In general, detecting and quantifying low prevalence RNAs is inherently more variable
than high abundance RNAs. As part of the ENCODE pipeline, annotated transcript and genes are
quantified using RSEM and the values are made available for downstream correlation analysis. Replicate
concordance: the gene level quantification should have a Spearman correlation of >0.9 between
isogenic replicates and >0.8 between anisogenic replicates.

### RNA extraction
- Sample processing and storage
- Total RNA/mRNA/small RNA
- DNAse treatment
- Quantity & quality
- RIN values (Strong effect)
- Batch effect
- Extraction method bias (GC bias)

{: .prereq}

**RNA Quantification and Quality Control: When working with bulk samples, throughout the various steps we periodically assess the quality and quantity of the RNA. This is typically done on a BioAnalyzer. Points to check are:**
a. Total RNA
b. After oligo-dT size selections
c. After rRNA-depletions
d. After library construction

### Library prep
- PolyA selection
- rRNA depletion
- Size selection
- PCR amplification (See section PCR duplicates)
- Stranded (directional) libraries
   - Accurately identify sense/antisense transcript
   - Resolve overlapping genes
- Exome capture
- Library normalisation
- Batch effect

### Sequencing: 
There are several sequencing platforms and technologies out there being used. It is important to provide the following pieces of information:
a. Platform: Illumina, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore, etc…
b. Format: Single-end, Pair-end,
c. Read Length: 101 bases, 125 bases, etc…
d. Unusual barcode placement and sequence: Some protocols introduce barcodes in noncustomary places. If you are going to deliver a FASTQ file that will contain the barcode
sequences in it or other molecular markers – you will need to report both the position in the
read(s) where they are and their sequence(s).
e. Please provide the sequence of any custom primers that were used to sequence the library

![RNA library]({{{site.baseurl}}/fig/sequencing.png)



### Sequencing depth.
The amount of sequencing needed for a given sample is determined by the goals of the experiment and
the nature of the RNA sample. Experiments whose purpose is to evaluate the similarity between the
transcriptional profiles of two polyA+ samples may require only modest depths of sequencing.
Experiments whose purpose is discovery of novel transcribed elements and strong quantification of
known transcript isoforms requires more extensive sequencing.  
• Each Long RNA-Seq library must have a minimum of 30 million aligned reads/mate-pairs.  
• Each RAMPAGE library must have a minimum of 20 million aligned reads/mate-pairs.  
• Each small RNA-Seq library must have a minimum of 30 million aligned reads/mate-pairs.  


### Quantitative Standards (spike-ins).
It is highly desirable to include a ladder of RNA spike-ins to calibrate quantification, sensitivity, coverage
and linearity. Information about the spikes should include the stage of sample preparation that the spiked
controls were added, as the point of entry affects use of spike data in the output. In general, introducing
spike-ins as early in the process as possible is the goal, with more elaborate uses of different spikes at
different steps being optional (e.g. before poly A+ selection, at the time of cDNA synthesis, or just prior to
sequencing). Different spike-in controls are needed for each of the RNA types being analyzed (e.g. long
RNAs require different quantitative controls from short RNAs). Such standards are not yet available for all
RNA types. Information about quantified standards should also include:
a) A FASTA (or other standard format) file containing the sequences of each spike in.
b) Source of the spike-ins (home-made, Ambion, etc..)
c) The concentration of each of the spike-ins in the pool used.

### QC FAIL?
https://sequencing.qcfail.com/


### Fastq format
FASTQ format is a text-based format for storing both a biological sequence (usually nucleotide sequence) and its corresponding quality scores.


The format is similar to fasta though there are differences in syntax as well as integration of quality scores. Each sequence requires at least 4 lines:

1. The first line is the sequence header which starts with an ‘@’ (not a ‘>’!).
Everything from the leading ‘@’ to the first whitespace character is considered the sequence identifier.
Everything after the first space is considered the sequence description
2. The second line is the sequence.
3. The third line starts with ‘+’ and can have the same sequence identifier appended (but usually doesn’t anymore).
4. The fourth line are the quality scores

The FastQ sequence identifier generally adheres to a particular format, all of which is information related to the sequencer and its position on the flowcell. The sequence description also follows a particular format and holds information regarding sample information.

### Quality Scores
Quality scores are a way to assign confidence to a particular base within a read. Some sequencers have their own proprietary quality encoding but most have adopted Phred-33 encoding. Each quality score represents the probability of an incorrect basecall at that position.

### Phred Quality Score Encoding
Quality scores started as numbers (0-40) but have since changed to an ASCII encoding to reduce filesize and make working with this format a bit easier, however they still hold the same information. ASCII codes are assigned based on the formula found below. This table can serve as a lookup as you progress through your analysis.

### Quality Score Interpretation
Once you know what each quality score represents you can then use this chart to understand the confidence in a particular base.

### More information is below.
http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/


### SAMtools
SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format is a generic format for storing large nucleotide sequence alignments. SAM aims to be a format that:

- Is flexible enough to store all the alignment information generated by various alignment programs;
- Is simple enough to be easily generated by alignment programs or converted from existing alignment formats;
- Is compact in file size;
- Allows most of operations on the alignment to work on a stream without loading the whole alignment into memory;
- Allows the file to be indexed by genomic position to efficiently retrieve all reads aligning to a locus.

SAM Tools provide various utilities for manipulating alignments in the SAM format, including sorting, merging, indexing and generating alignments in a per-position format. http://samtools.sourceforge.net/
```
samtools view -Sb align.sam > align.bam
samtools sort align.bam  -o align_sort.bam
samtools index align_sort.bam
samtools stats align_sort.bam > align_sort.bam.stat
cat align_sort.bam.stat
ls -algh
ls -alghtr
```

### BAM file
A BAM file (.bam) is the binary version of a SAM file. A SAM file (.sam) is a tab-delimited text file that contains sequence alignment data. 

|SAM/BAM|size|
|-----|----|
|align.sam | 903M|
|align.bam | 166M|


### Alignment visualization
