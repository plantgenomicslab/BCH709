> ## Markdown
> Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Its design allows it to be converted to many output formats, but the original tool by the same name only supports HTML.[8] Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.
>
> Since the initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and unanswered questions, the implementations that appeared over the years have subtle differences and many come with syntax extensions.
